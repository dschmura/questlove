## Working Documents Project

I created a questlove_working_documents which will be used to capture working documents for this project. In it I will keep a developer_journal etc... I am not including it with the source of this app, because it is really an artifact for exploring process, and not directly material to running this application. (It is kind of a 'behind the scenes' thing.)
